# Competitive Programming  

This repository contains my solutions to hundreds of problems from various online judges and competitive programming contests. These solutions span a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.  

## Platforms  

I regularly solve problems on the following platforms:  

- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)  
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)  
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/)  
- [ITACPC](https://itacpc.it/)  
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)  
- [Training Olinfo](https://training.olinfo.it/)  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is structured by platform, with each folder containing problem solutions categorized accordingly. Most solutions are implemented in C++, though other languages may be used occasionally.  

## How to Use  

Feel free to browse the solutions, analyze different problem-solving approaches, and use them as a learning resource. If you find any errors or have suggestions for optimization, contributions and discussions are always welcome!
